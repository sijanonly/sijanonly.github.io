    "Backpropagation is an efficient way of calculating gradients using chain rule.\n",

    "#### Gradient Descent:\n",
    "Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm which is used in different machine learning algorithms to find parameters/combination of parameters which mimimizes the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "** In case of neural network, we use backpropagation to calculate the gradient of loss function w.r.t to weights. Weights are the parameters of neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "** In case of linear regression, coefficients are the parameters!.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Many machine learning algorithms are convex problems, so using gradient descent to get extrema makes more sense. For example, if you remember the solution of linear regression :\n",

    "  Here, we can get the analytical solution by simply solving above equations. But, inverse calculation has $ O(N^3) $ complexity. It will be worst if our data size increases."

    "1. If we set $\\alpha$ to small, convergence will take longer.\n",
    "2. If we set $\\alpha$ to large, algorithm might overshoot the minimum and jumps to-and-fro. So, algorithm might not be converging, in worst, it diverges from actual minimal."
