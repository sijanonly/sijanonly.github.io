    "## Introduction: The Vision Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of enabling computers to perceive the world as humans do—recognizing objects, understanding scenes, and processing complex visual information in fractions of a second—has been a long-standing pursuit in computer vision research. Foundation models are significantly advancing this objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation models in computer vision signify a shift from traditional methodologies.
