    "Randomness is not a property of a phenomenon. It is simply an unpredectability of occurence of events around you.  It occurs in different scenarios of our life. For example, while roaming around street, you found a coin; now you would certainly look for other coin around that spot. But, there will be not any certainty or possibility or pattern of finding one. Other examples are - tossing coin / dice, fluctuating market prices for common goods.\n",

    "In probability, the current occurrence / selection you do for your experiment is an event. For example,fliping a coin is an event.And, the act of tossing the coin is called independent trail. If you do number of trails, it is called an experiment. And, all the possible outcomes of an experiment is called sample space. So, we can say that an event is also a subset of sample space.\n",
