    "\n",
    "A. Degree Centrality :\n",
    "\n",
    "   Degree centrality is considered as a local measure which captures the direct influence of a node and its access to first hand information in the network.\n",

    " \n",
    " For a directed graph, we can divide this measure into two:\n",
    " \n",
    "          a) Indegree centrality : It can measured by counting number of edges going into a vertex. A node having highest indegree cenrality can be seen as 'popular node .i.e having many followers.\n",
    "          \n",
    "          b) Outdegree centrality : It can measured by counting number of edges leaving a vertex. And a node with highest outdegree centrality can be seen as more social node i.e having good reach.\n",

    "          \n",
    "B. Closeness Centrality : \n",
    "\n",
    "   Closeness centrality says that important nodes are always stay close to other nodes. It can been as a measure of time to spread a message/information from a node to other nodes sequentially. It is calculated based on sum of the length of the shortest paths from a node to all other nodes.\n",

    "               \n",
    "   Since the sum of shortest paths between nodes u and v will be low if these two nodes are more central and will be high if those are less central, which is opposite to other centrality measures ( for Degree centrality: higher value signify higher centrality). Therefore, it is taken as inverse measure.\n",
